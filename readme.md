Because I couldn't find a large enough calendar in the shops I created one 
myself and had it printed out by a printshop. Although the design fits my needs, 
it is a lot of hassle to draw all the dates and occasions in by hand. Being a 
developer I decided it made sense to write some code to do the drawing for me.
